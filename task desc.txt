Task1 Description:
 
 
A Cloud Engineer needs a broad knowledge in the chosen field (Cloud, etc), but also needs to be able to talk directly to clients.
The engineer takes requirements from the clients and turns those into a cloud architecture.
 
The challenge for a cloud engineer is to provide a solution that fits the client's needs and is secure.
 
The client needs a Database which will be hosted on a VM itself, as it's a database not supported on RDS. Some Files will be stored on S3. For public facing website the client requires a web server instance. The client also has a processing Application, which crunches Data and puts it in the database. For this the client requires another VM. This task does not require the configuration of auto scaling features.
 
Please note:
	• No database needs to be installed.
	• The web server can just be a hello world example
	• Route53 configuration is not required
	• S3 access must not be routed through the internet
	• Security is an important requirement for the client
	• As this is just a mock task, please just use t2.micro
	• Think about network architecture
	• Provide access to and from the internet for this task.
 
Provide an architecture diagram, that shows how the AWS Account will look like (just provide a jpeg/png file), as well as the Terraform Code to provision this stack.
 
The presentation will be about your solution and should walk us through your decisions.
 
 
 
 
Task 2: Description:
 
The second task is as briefly describe at the beginning a presentation around your Terraform solution as well as a round about of Terraform.
 
It is not unusual, for a consultant to present the results of ones work, in some kind or another.
That is why we ask you, to prepare a presentation around ansible with a duration of around ten 
minutes. 
 
Please feel free, to be as broad and/or technical as you see fit. There is no limitations in this 
regard from our side.
This presentation will take place at the beginning of the technical interview.
 
We wish you good luck and are looking forward to seeing your creativity on how you tackled the deployment, as well as the presentation.
